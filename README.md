# Thoughts about the Process

This collaborative project has helped us familiarize ourselves with the process of successfully creating a full stack application together as a team. It was a great learning experience of overcoming issues that commonly appear while working as a team such as: Resolving Merge conflicts, Scheduling time to work together as a group, Assigning tasks to each member of the team, Managing time to deep work and resolve bugs efficiently, Communication skills, and more.
